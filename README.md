##  :green_book: About

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors web game where the user plays against the computer (random move generator).
I created this project to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation, as well as CSS styling, responsive design, and animations. It was also my first project using JavaScript.


##  :zap: Usage

Click on the move buttons to play the game. The game will keep track of the score. There is also a reset button to reset the score.

Alternatively, the game can be played using the keyboard:

* `r` - Rock
* `p` - Paper
* `s` - Scissors
* `q` - Reset Score
